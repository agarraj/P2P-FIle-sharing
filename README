=>i have two files "repo.txt" for storing repo data and "client_info.txt" for storing client information.

=> to search a file - search "keyword"

=> to share a file-   share "pathname"

=> to delete a file-   del "pathname"

=> client will automatically make a entry into client_info file when connection gets established.

=> To disconnect - disc "anything"

note- multithreading implemented only on server ends.
